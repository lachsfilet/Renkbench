# Renkbench
A Javascript Amiga Workbench 1.3.3 look and feel clone. [![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://github.com/lachsfilet/Renkbench/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Goal
For getting some Javascript practice, in the year 2009 I created an Amiga Workbench clone and hosted it on [Lachsfilet.de](http://www.lachsfilet.de/).
Since not all look and feel features of the orginal Workbench were implemented, in December of 2018 I started to refactor the code and added some missing features.

## Frontend features
Currently, the Workbench clone contains the following features:

* Drag and drop functionality for icons and windows
* Topaz style font
* Original window behavior with resizing and scrolling
* Window to the front and to the back buttons
* Closing of windows
* Directories displayed as drawers

## Todo

* Customized keyboard input using Topaz font
* Context menu in the main title bar triggered by mouse right click

## Backend

The old PHP 5.x backend must be reworked, updated or even replaced by something else. Or just removed.
