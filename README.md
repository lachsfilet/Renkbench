# Workbench
A Javascript Amiga Workbench 1.3.3 look and feel clone.

## Goal
For some Javascript practice, in the year 2009 I created an Amiga Workbench clone and hosted it on [Lachsfilet.de](https://www.lachsfilet.de/).
Since not all look and feel features of the orginal Workbench were implemented, in December of 2018 I started to refactor the code and added some missing features.

## Frontend features
Currently, the Workbench clone contains the following features

* Directories displayed as drawers
* Topaz style font
* Original window behavior with resizing and scrolling
* Window to the front and to the back buttons

## Backend

The old PHP 5.x backend must be reworked, updated or even replaced by something else. Or just removed.
